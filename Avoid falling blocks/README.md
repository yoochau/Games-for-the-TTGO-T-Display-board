# TTGO Demo
This is a demo project for the TTGO T-Display Board used in 159.236 at Massey.
It uses PlatformIO, the esp-idf and my own simple graphics library.
There are 3 environments defined in the platformio.ini file,
an emulator running under windows, an emulator running
on Linux and a real board. The default is the windows emulator, just uncomment the one you want.
